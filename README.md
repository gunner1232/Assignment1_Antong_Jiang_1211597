Here is a simple monthly accounting app I created. 
In this app, you can record all your income and expenses for the current month. 
By using the dropdown menu, you can choose to calculate the total expenses or the net balance for the month. 
After pressing the "Account" button, the result will be displayed in the "Result" field. 
Once you have calculated the monthly net balance, you can click the "Advise" button, and the app will provide reasonable advice based on your spending for the month in the "Comment" text box.
